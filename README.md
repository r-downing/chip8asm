# chip8asm

A basic chip8-assembler and disassembler with a custom assembly language. Written in python3. 

See [chip8asm/assembler.py](chip8asm/assembler.py) for assembly language reference.

The disassembler can be passed addresses and address-ranges to interpret as binary/sprite data instead of instructions.
